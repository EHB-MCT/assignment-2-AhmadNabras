# **Color Palette Generator (CPG)**

## **Overview**
The Color Palette Generator is a web application designed to let users create and save unique color palettes. When a user generates a palette and clicks the "Save Palette" button, the following actions take place:

- Palette Download: The palette is immediately downloaded to the userâ€™s computer as a JPG file for easy access  and sharing.

- Analytics Tracking: Simultaneously, the color palette data is sent to the backend, where it is added to a centralized database. This data helps track which colors and palettes are most frequently chosen by users.

A dedicated Analytics Page provides insights into color trends and user preferences. However, this page is accessible only to users with a login account, ensuring secure and personalized access to the analytics

---

## **Features**
- **Generate Color Palettes**: Create random color palettes.
- **Save Palettes**: Save color palettes associated with a user account.
- **Choose Shades**: Select shades for any color.
- **Export**: Download palettes as an image (JPG).
- **Analytics**: View an overview of color usage. **(Login required)**
- **Authentication**: Log in and register to see analystics.

---

## **Login Requirement**
To view the **Analytics** page, users must log in. If a user does not have an account, they can create one by signing up on the **Sign Up** page.

## **Technologies**
### **Frontend**
- Vue.js
- Vuetify (Material Design Framework)
- Chart.js (for analytics)

### **Backend**
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB (using Mongoose as ORM)

---

## **Installation**
### **Requirements**
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- A text editor, such as VS Code

### **Steps**
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install frontend dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install backend dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following:
   ```env
   MONGO_URI=<your-mongo-uri>
   JWT_SECRET=<your-secret-key>
   ```

5. **Start the application:**
   - **Backend**:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - **Frontend**:
     ```bash

## **Development Workflow**
To ensure an organized development process, feature branches were used. For instance:
- The **login-system** branch was created to implement the user authentication system, including login, signup, and restricted access to analytics.

This workflow ensures:
- Clear separation of concerns.
- Easier collaboration and code reviews.
- Safe integration into the main branch after thorough testing.

To view or work on the login-system branch:
```bash
git checkout login-system
```

---

## **Usage**
1. Register an account and log in.
2. Generate and save your favorite color palettes.
3. View analystics color in the analystic page.
4. Use the analytics page to analyze color usage. **(Login required)**

---

## **Potential Improvements**
- Real-time synchronization of color changes.
- Additional export options, such as PNG or PDF.
- Support for sharing palettes via unique URLs.
