# **Color Palette Generator (CPG)**

## **Overview**
The Color Palette Generator is a web application designed to let users create and save unique color palettes. When a user generates a palette and clicks the "Save Palette" button, the following actions take place:

- Palette Download: The palette is immediately downloaded to the userâ€™s computer as a JPG file for easy access  and sharing.

- Analytics Tracking: Simultaneously, the color palette data is sent to the backend, where it is added to a centralized database. This data helps track which colors and palettes are most frequently chosen by users.

A dedicated Analytics Page provides insights into color trends and user preferences. However, this page is accessible only to users with a login account, ensuring secure and personalized access to the analytics
